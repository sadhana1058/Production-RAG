The fiscal year naming correlates to the ending month of the given fiscal year, for example FY26 is GitLab’s fiscal year running February 1, 2025 to January 31, 2026.\n- Q1: February 1 through April 30\n- Q2: May 1 through July 31\n- Q3: August 1 through October 31\n- Q4: November 1 through January 31\nRefer to ourwriting style guidelinesfor proper use of date formats.\nREVENUE NON-COMMITTEE\n- Internal Management Members:Chief Financial Officer (DRI), Chief Executive Officer, Chief Revenue Officer (model, guidance, plan, target)\nINVOICE TEMPLATE AND WHERE TO SEND\nVendor invoices are to be sent toap@gitlab.comandpayroll@gitlab.comfor contractors. Aninvoicetemplate can be found in Google Docs by the name of “Invoice Template”.\nNon-US contractors not from Hungary, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Nigeria, South Africa, Switzerland, and Ukraine will get pay their monthly wages and expenses through iiPay. Here is the process:\n- enter bank information in Workday under Bank Information tab. Note - new contractor should enter their bank information within 3 business days from their start date.\n- enter VAT number if it is available\n- submit monthly salary/bonus/commission invoice in through Google form by the 8th of each month (as described to you during onboarding)\n- submit expenses through Navan Expense by the 8th of each month\n- the scheduled payment date is the 22nd of each month\n- iiPay will send out remittance advice along with the scheduled payment via your GitLab email address\nNon-US contractors from Italy, Nigeria, South Africa, Switzerland, and Ukraine will need to send their monthly invoice for salary/bonus/commission and anyexpensesby the 15th topayroll@gitlab.com.\nIn many cases, VAT will not be payable on transactions between GitLab BV and EU-based\nvendors/contractors, thanks to “Shifted VAT”. To make use of this shifted VAT:\n- The vendor/contractor writes the phrase “VAT shifted to recipient according to\narticle 44 and 196 of the European VAT Directive” on the invoice along with the\nVAT-number of GitLab IT BV (NL860316828B01).\n- On the vendor’s VAT return the revenue from GitLab BV goes to the rubric “Revenue within the EU”. It goes without saying that vendors are responsible for their own correct and timely filings.\n- GitLab BV files the VAT on the VAT return, and is generally able to deduct this VAT all as part of the same return.\nTIMESHEETS FOR HOURLY EMPLOYEES\n- People Ops and Finance will share a private Google Sheet with you where you will log your hours for each day in the “hours” column.\n- There is a dropdown in the “pay type” column, with the default being Regular. There are also options for Overtime, Vacation, Sick, and Bereavement. Choose the appropriate pay type for your time.\n- If you work overtime or more hours than agreed upon in your contract, please obtain approval from your manager and forward to Finance before payroll cutoff.\n- Your timesheet is due one day prior to the submit payroll date, which is outlined for the calendar year on your timesheet.\nHOW SPEND IS ALLOCATED TO DEPARTMENTS\nBudgets are aligned to departments, and budgets follow the owner who requested the spend. When determining who should request the spend, consider the owner of the outcome.\nFor example, work to enable a sales partner that will not be incorporated into the product would go to Sales. Work that will be part of the product and supported by engineering, should be charged to the Engineering budget.\nFINANCE BUSINESS PARTNER ALIGNMENT\nTYPES OF WORK THAT THE TEAM DOES\n- Level 1: Keeping the lights on activity. Always striving to make this area as efficient as possible so more Layer 2 focus can be attained. Example: closing the books.\n- Level 2: Operational Efficiencies, Business Engagement and Partnering, actionable insights for the organization. Examples: improving close process, partnering with sales to make a business decision", "source_path": "data/raw/pages/finance-5e3625886d.html"}

In the case that other team members are aware of a team member’s emergency (during a Zoom call for example) and wish to call that country’s emergency services on the original team member’s behalf, we do not recommend this as only certain People Ops team members have access to team member addresses and we would take on the role of communicating with emergency services, should this extremely rare situation arise.\nIn the event a team member is in an unsafe situation due to a natural disaster, please see theDisaster Recovery Planpage.\nHOW TO REPORT VIOLATIONS\nAs stated in theCode of Business Conduct and Ethics, we have a section related to reporting violations.

As these matters may relate to individual team members or groups of team members, they are appropriately managed in a confidential manner.\nIf the Legal, Employment team makes a request for support or assistance from the People Operations team, the request should be formulated using a template (linked here, though accessible internally only to Legal, Employment and the People Operations team).\nThe request should includeallthe required detail and explanation to enable People Operations to support, including:\n- An explanation of what is needed\n- Whether there’s a timeline on the request (ensuring People Operations are provided with as much lead time as possible)\n- Whether all the information needed, has been provided, eg contact names, dual language translations if applicable, links to any relevant documents etc\n- A note on whether an FAQ to share with team members is needed or whether People Operatons have enough information to answer any questions which might arise\n- Whether there are any follow up actions for legal or for People Operations\n- A short explanation or summary (if necessary) or courtesy update for the managers of any affected team members\n- Whether confirmation of completion is needed\nTo make a request, a copy of the template should be saved, filled out as above, dated and passed to the People Operations Manager so the request can be assessed and assigned to a member of the People Operations team for completion. Once assigned, the member of the People Operations team who will be assisting with the request should touch base with the member of the Legal, Employment team who has made the request, to confirm that the request is being worked on and so it’s easy to collaborate on finishing out the task.\nSUPPORT PROVIDED BY THE PEOPLE OPERATIONS TEAM TO THE PEOPLE BUSINESS PARTNER TEAM\nMost tasks/requests from the People Business Partners for the People Operations team will be handled via a HelpLab.

However, there are instances where a profile is identified and there is question on whether the person is truly a GitLab team member. Here is the process for flagging a potentially inaccurate profile and the actions that the People Operations Team will do to confirm and potentially report a profile.\n- Team members should first check in Slack and/or on the organizational page to determine if the team member is a current GitLab team member.\n- If the team member cannot confirm the profile, team members should reach out to the People Operations Team viaHelpLabwith the LinkedIn profile in question.\n- The People Operations team member will confirm in Workday that they are not/have not been a team member.\n- The People Operations team member will confirm with talent acquisition to confirm if they have ever been interviewed, made an offer or were declined.\n- The People Operations team member will reach out to theDeveloper Relations teamto confirm if they are an active wider community member via the#developer-relationsSlack channel, using the@devrel-teamtag.\n- If they are a confirmed member of the wider community but not a team member, the Developer Relations team will reach out the profile and ask them to change their profile to match their GitLab involvement.\n- If they are not a current member of the wider community and talent acquisition has confirmed they do not have a profile in Greenhouse, talent acquisition will create a Do Not Hire profile.\n- The People Operations team member will report the account to LinkedIn via theReporting Inaccurate Information on Another Member’s Profile\nUSING WORKDAY\nWe use Workday to maintain team member information.

In practice, non-linear career growth is an opportunity for team members to increase efficiency with new skills, develop as leaders with new responsibilities, and grow as an expert in their field.\nBut growth only happens when we make intentional time and space to learn.\nAs a People Group, we’re embracing this attitude of continuous learning together, with the challenge that, as a team, we can spend a total of300 hourslearning before the end of FY25 Q3! We encourage everyone to participate, spending approx. 2 hours per month learning something new, as a way to prioritize your development and use work time to uplevel and upskill.\nAt the end of the quarter, we’ll ask folks to self-report hours spent learning, and take a tally of total People Group learning hours.\nHere are a few ways you might spend time learning this quarter:\n- Create an IGPto track and monitor your growth goals\n- Utilize theGrowth and Development Fundto engage in a class or conference\n- Organize ajob shadoworinternship for learningto increase exposure and collaboration with different roles and teams.\n- Attend an AMA or async Group Conversation, and contribute by asking a question.\n- Organize a discussion on your team about a shared topic (i.e. article, book, or podcast on a topic that is relevant to your team’s work)\n- Attend a TMRG career growth event\nWe encourage everyone to have an ongoing conversation about career growth with their manager during weekly 1:1s. If this isn’t already part of your weekly check in, consider adding it to your agenda template now!\nInvesting in your growth is essential for both your individual success and the success of our entire team. Let’s start learning together!\nOTHER PAGES RELATED TO THE PEOPLE GROUP\nPEOPLE BUSINESS PARTNERS\n- People Business Partner Team\nTOTAL REWARDS\n- Benefits\n- Global Compensation\nPEOPLE OPERATIONS\n- Code of Business Conduct and Ethics\n- Promotions and Transfers\n- Employment Solutions (International Expansion)\n- Contracts\n- Probation Periods & PIAA\n- Onboarding\n- Offboarding\n- Celebrations\n- People Operations\n- People Analytics\nTALENT ACQUISITION\n- Incentives\n- Hiring process\n- Leadership\nLEARNING AND DEVELOPMENT\n- Learning & Development\n- Guidance on Feedback\nDIVERSITY, INCLUSION AND BELONGING\n- Gender and Sexual-orientation Identity Definitions and FAQ\nOTHER PEOPLE GROUP LINKS\n- People Policy Directory\n- Underperformance\n- Visas\n- Leadership handbook\n- People Key Performance Indicators\n- People Performance Indicators", "source_path": "data/raw/pages/people-group-639c1669d4.html"}

These are :\n- Application Security\n- Infrastructure Security\n- Security Platforms and Architecture\n- Vulnerability Management\n- Data Security\n- Security Incident Response Team (SIRT)\n- Trust and Safety\n- Red Team\n- Threat Intelligence\n- Signals Engineering\n- Security Logging\n- Corporate Security\n- Helpdesk Support\n- Tech Stack Systems\n- Engineering Teams\n- Field Security\n- Security Compliance\n- Security Governance\n- Security Risk\nSECURE THE PRODUCT - THE PRODUCT SECURITY DEPARTMENT\nTheProduct Security Departmentis primarily focused on Securing the Product. This reflects the Security Division’s current efforts to be involved in the Application development and Release cycle for Security Releases, Infrastructure Security, and our HackerOne bug bounty program.\nThe term “Product” is interpreted broadly and includes the GitLab application itself and all other integrations and code that is developed internally to support the GitLab application for the multi-tenant SaaS. Our responsibility is to ensure all aspects of GitLab that are exposed to customers or that host customer data are held to the highest security standards, and to be proactive and responsive to ensure world-class security in anything GitLab offers.\nPROTECT THE COMPANY - THE SECURITY OPERATIONS DEPARTMENT\nSecurity Operations Departmentteams are primarily focused on protecting GitLab the business and GitLab’s platform. This encompasses protecting company property as well as to prevent, detect and respond to risks and events targeting the business and our platform. This department includes the Security Incident Response Team (SIRT) and the Trust and Safety team.\nThese functions have the responsibility of shoring up and maintaining the security posture of GitLab’s platform to ensure enterprise-level security is in place to protect our new and existing customers.\nLEAD WITH DATA - THE THREAT MANAGEMENT DEPARTMENT\nThreat Management Departmentteams are cross-functional. They are responsible for collaborating across the Security Division to identify, communicate, and remediate threats or vulnerabilities that may impact GitLab, our Team Members or our users and the community at large.\nASSURE THE CUSTOMER - THE SECURITY ASSURANCE DEPARTMENT\nTheSecurity Assurance Departmentis comprised of the teams noted above. They target Customer Assurance projects among their responsibilities. This reflects the need for us to provide resources to our customers to assure them of the security and safety of GitLab as an application to use within their organisation and as a enterprise-level SaaS. This also involves providing appropriate support, services and resources to customers so that they trust GitLab as a Secure Company, as a Secure Product, and Secure SaaS\nPROTECT THE ORGANIZATION - CORPORATE SECURITY\nGitLab is both a company and a product. TheCorporate Securitydepartment focuses on implementing and protecting the information technology (IT) related systems that the company uses to conduct business internally, and provides the hardware, software, and tools that our team members and 3rd party service providers (aka contractors) need to be productive and get their job done efficiently.

Our updates are open to all GitLab team members using the following process:\n- Start of each month:A thread per-department is started in#security_discussby each department leader (CorpSec, ProdSec, SecAssurance, SecOps). These threads are pinned for the duration of the month.Thread template:<MONTH> <DEPARMENT> Weekly UpdatesExample:August Product Security Weekly Updates\n- Thread template:<MONTH> <DEPARMENT> Weekly UpdatesExample:August Product Security Weekly Updates\n- <MONTH> <DEPARMENT> Weekly Updates\n- Example:August Product Security Weekly Updates\n- Weekly:At least once a week, teams provide updates they wish to share within the appropriate thread. For example, updates from Vulnerability Management would be placed in the Product Security thread for the given month.These weekly updates, while highly encouraged, are strictly optional and should represent content that ICs and managers feel should be highlighted. Teams are encouraged to define processes and DRIs around these updates that work for them.Individuals providing the weekly updates are encouraged to use the “Also send to #security_discuss” option within the thread to increase visibility.\n- These weekly updates, while highly encouraged, are strictly optional and should represent content that ICs and managers feel should be highlighted. Teams are encouraged to define processes and DRIs around these updates that work for them.\n- Individuals providing the weekly updates are encouraged to use the “Also send to #security_discuss” option within the thread to increase visibility.\n- End of each month:Departmental leaders prepare a monthly update, including no more thanthree updates per team, and post it in#cisowithin the first week of the following month.Each monthly update should include a brief preface written by the departmental leader covering any notable themes or other strategic updates.Each of the three updates per-team should be no more than 2-3 sentences and include at least one link to allow readers to gain additional context. Links should be to GitLab Issues or Epics wherever possible. If information is confidential and not able to be added to an Issue or Epic, a note should be added indicating this.It is recommended that departmental leaders build their monthly update over the course of the month via a GitLab issue (see an example) in collaboration with their managers and senior ICs.\n- Each monthly update should include a brief preface written by the departmental leader covering any notable themes or other strategic updates.\n- Each of the three updates per-team should be no more than 2-3 sentences and include at least one link to allow readers to gain additional context.

For detailed requirements regarding the use of tokens at GitLab, please see ourtoken management standard.\n- When creating aPersonal Access Token, be sure to choose the appropriatescopesthat only have the permissions that are absolutely necessary.\n- Oftentimes aProject Access Tokenmight be sufficient instead of a Personal Access Token. Project Access Tokens have a much more limited scope and should be preferred over Personal Access Tokens whenever possible.\n- Always set an expiration for your tokens when creating them. Tokens should preferably expire in a matter of hours or a day.\n- Be mindful to keep these personal access tokens secret. Be particularly careful not to accidentally commit them in configuration files, paste them into issue or merge request comments, or otherwise expose them.\n- Please consider periodically reviewing your currently active Personal Access Tokens and revoking any that are no longer needed.\n- Personal Access Tokens will be highly discouraged within the GitLab production environment, and disallowed/disabled wherever possible. Existing tokens shall remain, but additional issuance will not be permissible/possible.\n- If you believe a personal access token has been leaked, revoke it immediately (if possible) andcontact the security teamusing the/securitySlack command.\nRECEIVE NOTIFICATION OF SECURITY RELEASES\n- To receive security release blog notifications delivered to your inbox, visit ourcontact uspage.\n- To receive release notifications via RSS, subscribe to oursecurity release RSS feedor ourRSS feed for all releases.\n- For additional information regarding security releases, please visit the Delivery Team’ssecurity releasespage.\nRESOURCES\nTOOLS\n- Incident-Tools (private)for working scripts and other code during or while remediating an incident.\nIf the tool is applicable outside of theGitLab.comenvironment, consider\nif it’s possible to release when the~securityissue becomes\nnon-confidential. This group can also be used for private demonstration projects for\nsecurity issues.\n- security-tools (mostly private)contains some\noperational tools used by the security teams. Contents and/or configurations\nrequire that most of these projects remain private.\nCALENDAR\nWe welcome GitLab team members to join meetings that are on our sharedSecurity Calendar.\nOTHER FREQUENTLY USED GITLAB.COM PROJECTS\nSecurity crosses many teams in the company, so you will find~securitylabeled\nissues across all GitLab projects, especially:\n- gitlab-foss\n- gitlab\n- infrastructure\n- production\nWhen opening issues, please follow theCreating New Security Issuesprocess for using labels and the confidential flag.\nOTHER RESOURCES FOR GITLAB TEAM MEMBERS\n- Security Best Practices, using 1Password and similar tools, are documented\non their own security best practices page.\n- Secure Coding Training.\n- GitLab.comdata breach notification policy.\n- GitLab Internal Acceptable UsePolicy.\n- For GitLab.com, we have developed aGoogle Cloud Platform (GCP) Security Guidelines Policydocument, which outlines recommended best practices, and is enforced through\nour security automation initiatives.\n- GitLab Security Tanuki for use on security release blogs, social media and security related swag as appropriate:Web-RGBPrint-CMYKand oneexclusively for stickers.\n- Web-RGB\n- Print-CMYK\n- and oneexclusively for stickers.\n- Security READMEs\n- Working in Security\n- Contributing to GitLab the product as a Security team member\n- Threat Modeling", "source_path": "data/raw/pages/security-ffb7010cbf.html"}
